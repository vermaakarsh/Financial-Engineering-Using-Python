    "\n",
    "- **Why Use Computers in Trading?**\n",
    "  - Trading involves analyzing large datasets, applying indicators, and executing orders—all of which can be automated with computers.\n",
    "    - Computers can process vast amounts of data quickly, making them essential for modern trading.\n",
    "  - Computers operate using binary code (0s and 1s), but we interact with them through higher-level programming languages.\n",
    "    - Programming languages like Python allow us to write instructions that computers can understand and execute.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What Is Source Code?**\n",
    "  - Source code is a set of instructions written in a language like Python.\n",
    "  - In trading, it defines when to buy, sell, or hold—based on predefined logic or indicators.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Programs**\n",
    "  - A program is a structured set of instructions a computer follows to perform tasks such as calculating a moving average or executing trades.\n",
    "  - **Programming** is the process of writing these instructions in a clear and logical way.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computer Science vs. Programming**\n",
    "  - **Computer Science** explores what’s theoretically possible with computers.\n",
    "  - **Programming** applies that theory to create real-world tools—like an automated trading bot.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Python Is Ideal for Traders**\n",
    "  - Python is simple, readable, and has extensive libraries for financial analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.\n",
    "  - It’s widely adopted in the trading community for backtesting and live strategies.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Skills for Trading Programmers**\n",
    "  1. **Problem-Solving**: Deconstruct trading problems into small, logical steps.\n",
    "  2. **Precision**: Computers execute exactly what you write—being precise avoids costly mistakes.\n",
    "  3. **Syntax Mastery**: Understanding Python’s rules ensures your code runs correctly.\n",
    "  4. **Practical Example**\n",
    "      - If your current balance is `X` and you want to add 10 after each trade:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        new_balance = X + 10\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logical Thinking in Programming**\n",
    "  - Think of programming as a series of logical steps:\n",
    "    1. Define your goal (e.g., buy when the price is low).\n",
    "    2. Break it down into smaller tasks (e.g., check the price, compare with a threshold).\n",
    "    3. Write code to automate these tasks.\n",
    "- **Best Practices in Trading Code**\n",
    "  - Keep your code clean, modular, and readable.\n",
    "  - Use descriptive variable names like `entry_price` or `moving_average` to make your logic clear and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sharpening Your Skills**\n",
    "  - Regular practice helps build computational thinking and the ability to automate trading strategies effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "- Programming empowers traders to design, test, and automate strategies.\n",
    "- With logical thinking, clean code, and continuous practice, anyone can become proficient—even without a technical background.\n",
